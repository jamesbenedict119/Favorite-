    I like the green tree python because it’s beautifully colored, graceful in how it coils among branches, and fascinating in its arboreal lifestyle.  
    Its emerald-green skin helps it blend into foliage, and the way it hunts from trees makes it mysterious and elegant.

  <h2>Cool Facts About Snakes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Snakes don’t have eyelids — their eyes are covered by a clear scale called a *spectacle*.</li>
    <li>Some snakes (including many pythons) use heat-sensing pits to detect warm-blooded prey even in low light.</li>
    <li>Snakes can unhinge parts of their jaws (the two halves of the lower jaw) so they can swallow prey much larger than their head.</li>
  </ul>
